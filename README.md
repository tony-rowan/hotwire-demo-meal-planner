# Hotwire Demo - Meal Planner

Rails app to help users plan their meals demonstrating how you can use Turbo
to create an single page app that updates in realtime with absolutely no
custom javascript.

The app demonstrates how to hook up turbo frames and streams where the
displayed 'model' is not database backed. Here we want a static view on dates,
but we want to perform CRUD on meals.
